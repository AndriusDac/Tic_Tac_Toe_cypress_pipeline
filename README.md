## Features

- Displays the current player and the winner.
- Reset button to start a new game.
- Simple and responsive design.
- Tested with **Cypress** for end-to-end testing.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS (inline styling)
- Cypress (for testing)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

### Installation

   git clone https://github.com/username/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

### Running Tests

This project uses **Cypress** for testing. To run the tests, use the following commands:

1. Open the Cypress interface:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

2. Run all tests from the Cypress UI.

Alternatively, you can run tests directly from the command line:

```bash

```

## Test Cases (TC)

🔹 TC01: Verify that the game board is displayed with 9 clickable squares.  
🔹 TC02: Verify that the "Reset" button is displayed.  
🔹 TC03: Verify that the current player ("X" or "O") is displayed correctly.  
🔹 TC04: Verify that clicking on an empty square marks it with the current player's symbol ("X" or "O").  
🔹 TC05: Verify that clicking on an already marked square does not change its symbol.  
🔹 TC06: Verify that the current player changes after a valid move.  
🔹 TC07: Verify that the game detects a win when a player aligns three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  
🔹 TC08: Verify that the game displays the winning message and disables further moves after a win.  
🔹 TC09: Verify that the game detects a draw when all squares are filled with no winner.  
🔹 TC10: Verify that the game displays a draw message.  
🔹 TC11: Verify that clicking the "Reset" button clears the board and starts a new game.  
🔹 TC12: Verify that the current player is reset to "X" after clicking the "Reset" button.
